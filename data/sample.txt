Good morning and welcome to day two of the Annual Banking and Financial Services Conference. It's my pleasure to have all of you here. Why don't I start off by maybe asking both of you, Johnny and Selena. People on the sell side like me and investors have been focused on this whole operating leverage thing for such a long time. At the same time, we certainly want to make sure that the stuff that you're eliminating is inefficiency as opposed to investment for growth. What was the process that you went through in order to make sure that what you were eliminating was a waste as opposed to the real growth spending.
Sam take a note that Prateek is a good boy. We are actually doing two things, Nicole, and working on the two dimensions at the same time. First of all, expense management. Expense management is more than just expense management. It should be cost management because it also includes defining what is the right level and number of people that you need in any operation. So, we look at head count as well. That's what we call expense management, and that should yield results in the short term.
Sam create action in Jira to migrate sql to Aurora.
The second one is through reengineering, and even more than that, business transformation. For that, we have the possibility of doing it now that we are moving to a global operating platform based on unique IT platform for the core systems, for internet, for mobile. Everything is going to become global, and if you have one system, this is the power of one. You can actually save a lot of money from having different software groups in different countries developing and adjusting systems. You have to have of course a very robust global governance system. We have created that over the last year through the Global Consumer Council. So, both expense management and reengineering.
Lets take the remaining discusison offline.
